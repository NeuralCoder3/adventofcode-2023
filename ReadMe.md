# Advent of Code 2023

Fork of https://github.com/NeuralCoder3/adventofcode-ocaml-template
(But not a real fork due to Github limitations.)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an online advent calendar with coding challenges.

I mostly solve the problems in OCaml as a demonstration.
I usually wait a few days to not spoil the fun of solving the exercises for others who might be tempted.
