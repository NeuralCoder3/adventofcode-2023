# Advent of Code 2023

(But not a real fork due to Github limitations.)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an online advent calendar with coding challenges.

I mostly solve the problems in OCaml as a demonstration.
I usually wait a few days to not spoil the fun of solving the exercises for others who might be tempted.

I use simple algorithms that are fast enough to solve the problem.
Sometimes, I will annotate with comments how a faster solution would work.
However, I want to restrict myself mostly to techniques shown in the Programming 1 lecture.
In general, unnecessary optimizations can lead to less readability and increased complexity and development time.
You should not just blindly use the fastest way for the sake of it.
My solutions won't be the most elegant, fastest, simplest, shortest, ...
